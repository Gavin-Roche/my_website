# My Personal Website
This is the source code for my personal website. I built it completely from scratch no frameworks, no Bootstrap, just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I wrote myself. The site includes a homepage, an About Me page, a projects section, and a contact form. I also added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn so people can check out my work or reach out. Itâ€™s fully responsive and designed to be clean and simple. This project was a way for me to learn more about web development, improve my front-end skills, and get hands-on experience building something real from the ground up.
