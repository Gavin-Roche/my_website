# My Personal Website
This is the source code for my personal website. I built it completely from scratch no frameworks, no Bootstrap, just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I wrote myself. The goal was to build a fast, clean, and fully responsive site that works well on any device, and gives me full control over how everything looks and behaves.

The website includes six main pages: a homepage, an About Me page, a Projects page, a Contact Me page with a working email form, a Legal page with disclaimers and licensing info, and a Thank You page that appears after form submission. I've also included links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles so visitors can view my work or reach out directly.

The project is organized into two main folders: [src/](/scr/) contains the original source files, while [docs/](/docs/) holds the optimized production build thatâ€™s deployed via GitHub Pages. This setup allows me to keep development and deployment separate, making it easier to manage updates and changes. CSS and JavaScript files have been manually optimized and minified for better performance.

I built this site as a way to learn more about front-end web development, practice clean coding, and gain hands-on experience building and maintaining a real-world project. It was also a great exercise in structuring code for both development and production workflows using a simple but effective setup.
